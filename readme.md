Just connect your SHT85 board to Arduino, ESP or any other board with MicroPython firmware.

Supply voltage SHT85 from 2.15 to 5.5 volts, typical 3.3 Volt! Use four wires to connect.

Copy the following files to your board:
    main.py
    sht85sen.py
    crc1wire.py
    sensor_pack folder

Then open main.py in your IDE and run it!
